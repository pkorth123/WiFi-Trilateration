WiFi Trilateration Project


The included file, "03-mediach6b.txt" is not a complete capture and cannot be completely parsed without errors but is small enough to upload to github. The complete .txt file I have been working with is over 150MB and cannot be uploaded to github. To see the functionality of the program change the bufferreader to point at the location and name of the included .txt file. This is a capture of more than one device and incomplete but will show the second at which the frame was received (at 10x speed), the signal strength in dBm, and the associated distance from the access point that this represents in meters.
