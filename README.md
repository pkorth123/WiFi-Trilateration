WiFi Trilateration Project


The included file, "03-mediach6b.txt" is not a complete capture and cannot be completely parsed. The .txt file I have been working with is over 150MB and cannot be uploaded to github. This file with finish with an error as it is incomplete and also does not have signal strength data as it was a broad capture of many devices. It simply shows the functionality of the code at parsing out the numbers required in calculating the distance from an access point. The majority of this project, up to this point, has been preparing a hardware setup that will let me interact with the values I need. To test the file that is included, change the bufferreader to point at the location of the .txt file.
